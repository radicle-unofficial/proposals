## Functional Description

This is a proposal to distribute LBP unsold tokens to the LBP holders in proportion to their 
contribution, as a result of [Structured Disscussion][sd], we're now putting forward this 
proposal for distributing `15161.42475` to the LBP holders from the LBP unsold tokens.


## Purpose

This distribution would help the project by putting more votes into the hands of individual 
community members. Putting it straight back into the treasury essentially puts it under the 
control of the early backers as they still have most of the votes.


## Background

Early supporters of Radicle were able to become part of the community by buying the Rad 
token for $1.5 USD. LBP supporters paid between $10 and $30. LBP contributors support the 
project just as much as the early backers who were allowed to join in for just $1.5 and 
should be rewarded for it with a share of the unsold tokens.


## Reasoning & Analysis

This distribution would help the project by putting more votes into the hands of individual 
community members. Putting it straight back into the treasury essentially puts it under the 
control of the early backers as they still have most of the votes. And there will be more 
radicle strong holders. ~~I donâ€™t think there are any drawbacks.~~


## Impact

This distribution would help the project by putting more votes into the hands of individual 
community members. Putting it straight back into the treasury essentially puts it under the 
control of the early backers as they still have most of the votes.
